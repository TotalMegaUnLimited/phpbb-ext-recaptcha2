**NOTE** phpBB 3.2.x now comes supplied with reCAPTCHA 2 built-in. You should use the
built-in version. People supporting older boards (until 3.1.x is out of support) may
still want to use the 
[v1.0.4 release](https://github.com/gothick/phpbb-ext-recaptcha2/releases/latest) of
this extension to get reCAPTCHA 2. 

This is not official phpBB software. It seems to work for me, but your mileage
may vary, and I give no guarantees!
