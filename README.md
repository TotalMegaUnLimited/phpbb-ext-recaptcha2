**Note**: This is not official phpBB software. Recent releases should be compatible with
phpBB 3.2.x (tested with 3.2.1+). It seems to work for me, but your mileage may vary, and
I give no guarantees!

Current status: Initial release. Seems to be in use by quite a few people, given the
number of contributions I've seen. I've been using it on my live (but not terribly busy) 
board for months.
